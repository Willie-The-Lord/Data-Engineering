# Data Science
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data.

## 📌**About this REPO**
A place where I practice several programming languages (including their syntaxes) and implement different databases (including Relational or Non-relational databases) in real-world practices.

✅Current playing around with SQL & Scala:
- Why SQL? SQL is an exceptional reason programming language that is utilized to interface with databases.
- Why Scala? Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. 

✅In the future:
I will be focusing on different database-implementations and other data science techniques... Stay TUNED!
